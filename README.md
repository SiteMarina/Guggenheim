## Let's kick things off with a demo \o/

## Idea
Guggenheim is a plugin for [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) which generates beautiful galleries through an algorithm for a perfectly balanced layout, which you might know from [medium.com's awesome image grids](https://medium.com/the-story/introducing-image-grids-c592e5bc16d8).

Read more into the math and science behind the algorithm here: [The algorithm for a perfectly balanced photo gallery](https://www.crispymtn.com/stories/the-algorithm-for-a-perfectly-balanced-photo-gallery)

In my search for the perfect gallery, which could do this linear partition against the images,
I really wasen't getting excited about all the countless client-side javascript solutions to the problem.
As I care deeply about mobile, i simply didn't wanted to make the devices responsible for this task and wanted a PHP solution for the linear partition.

## Moral License
Feel free to test out the gallery - But if you like it, please please (please) consider buying one (or more, if you really like it) per domain Moral License / Donation here https://sitemarina.github.io/guggenheim/ - **I am currently struggling pretty bad ðŸ˜¥**

The code doesn't phone home, it doens't check for any license code, I'm never going to hack or DDoS your ass for anything.

If you don't have any money, I'm not expecting anything from you (I'm currently there), and you can use it for free to get back on your feet.
But I might have to take it down if this doesn't work out, on the other hand I will love to make it completely free as soon as possible.

## Setup
Grab yourself a copy of the most [awesome NoDB file-based CMS ever Kirby](http://getkirby.com)

1. Copy the guggenheim folder into site/plugins
2. Integrate the styles from [guggenheim/guggenheim.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiteMarina/guggenheim/master/guggenheim/guggenheim.css) into your frontend design or framework
3. Spice it up with [PhotoSwipe (get it here)](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) and utilize it by integrating [guggenheim/guggenheim-hearts-photoswipe.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiteMarina/guggenheim/master/guggenheim/guggenheim-hearts-photoswipe.js) into your frontend design or framework

## Settings
in your site/config/config.php

```php
// Add aditional classes to the guggenheim gallery element
c::set('guggenheim.classes', 'gallery zoom margin-center');

// Guggenheim is meant to be used with PhotoSwipe
// But if you for some reason don't want to use it, you can remove it additionals with
c::set('guggenheim.photoswipe', false);

// Guggenheim uses some basic srcset and sizes for basic responsiveness and highres support
// if you want to disable it, and make your own
c::set('guggenheim.srcset', false);

// Guggenheim adds a kirbytext tag, the default is 'gallery', but you can change it with
c::set('guggenheim.kirbytext.tagname', 'guggenheim');
```

## Usage


### With kirbytext

**Super simplistic -Generate a Guggenheim gallery with all the page images**
```markdown
(gallery:) or (gallery: all)
```

**More generally, you want to pick out the pictures to make the gallery from, you do it like this**
```markdown
Comma separated:
(gallery: image-1.jpg, image-2.jpg, image-3.jpg)

Pipe separated:
(gallery: image-1.jpg | image-2.jpg | image-3.jpg)

..heck even both:
(gallery: image-1.jpg | image-2.jpg, image-3.jpg)
```

**Options**

Guggenheim lets you set some options for each gallery.

- **width** Which is the width of the gallery, all image will be resized through a linear partition to fit this width, and it will also be the max-width of the gallery (to prevent upscaling).
- **height** This is a ideal hight for images to fit too, it'll only be used as a guideline for the linear partition to maximum fit into, it's there for you to play around with for each specifik gallery
- **border** Sets the space between images in pixels

```markdown
(gallery: image-1.jpg, image-2.jpg, image-3.jpg width: 800 height: 350 border: 10)
```

### In your templates
Use the Guggenheim gallery in your templates

```php
$images = $page->images()->sortBy('sort', 'asc');
echo guggenheim($images, array('width' => 800, 'height' => 350, 'border' => 10));
```

## Features
- _Mostly_ perfect balanced gallery generated by a linear partition algorithm server-side, to preventing the usual overhead that JavaScript brings in terms of browser paint, reflows, grid calculations and DOM manipulations.
- If a 'caption' field is present for the image, it'll be added as a visually hidden figcaption, visible when opened in PhotoSwipe.
